# reinvest_dividend
Python calculator to calculate how much a dividend stock will earn on a fixed basis. Not for an accurate growth model, just for a general idea for curious minds. 
Put how much you have or would put into a divdidend stock into the inital_invesment input.Figure out how often the dividend is paid and if it's a monthly divdend add the dividend twice to the original dividend and then put that number into the quarterly_dividend input. Put your goal into the investment_goal input.

Example for monthly dividend payout: Ticker:X Monthly Dividend:0.20
0.20 + 0.20 + 0.20 = 0.60 
0.60 is the quarterly dividend for this example and is what we would put in the quarterly dividend input.

Don't forget if it is a monthly dividend your goal should be 3 times the monthly output.
Example for monthly dividend goal: Ticker:X Monthly Dividend goal:100
100 + 100 + 100 = 300
300 is the quartlery dividend goal for this example and is what we would put in the dividend_goal input.
